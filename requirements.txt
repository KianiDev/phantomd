# Development / testing packages have been intentionally removed from this file.
# If you are developing or running tests install them separately, for example:
#   pip install pytest hypothesis boofuzz
# Notes:
# - Some packages (cryptography, aioquic) may require system build deps (libssl-dev, rustc, cargo)
#   to build from source; prefer installing binary wheels on supported platforms or
#   install optional build deps separately if you need to compile from source.
